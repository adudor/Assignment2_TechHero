		<h2>Early Life</h2>
		<p>Joy Buolamwini was born In Alberta, Canada, and grew up in the state of Mississipi.</p>
		
		<h2>Achievements</h2>
		<section id=Achievements>
		<p>Joy Buolamwini has done many great things while working to combat implicit bias that can be found in many AI technologies, including: 
			<ul>
				<li>She founded the Algorithmic Justice League in 2016, which has raised public awareness of impacts that AI can have, seek to improve algorithm technologies used today, and more.</li>
				<li>She sent over 1000 young women of color to a coding camp, made possible by a Twitter Campaign she launched called <strong>#decodeTheBias</strong></li>
				<li>She worked with ORCAA and found subtle bias in the Skin Advisor Algorithm that the well known skincare brand Olay uses, which they have since improved</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Why She's a Tech Hero of Mine</h2>
		<p>
		One reason why Joy Buolamwini is a tech hero of mine is because she was able to discover and work to solve instances of racial bias in AI where no one else had even looked,
		the main example being with Olay's Skin Advisor Algorithm. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Another reason why Joy Buolamwini is a tech hero of mine is because she goes out of her way to give access to extremely valueable skills, like coding,
		to young women who otherwise wouldn't have access to those kinds of opportunities.
