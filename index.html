		<h2>The Interviewing Process</h2>
		<p><t>For this assignment we used Zoom to do our interview, and our recording of the video can be viewed below. Overall, the interview process went fairly smoothly.
			We hadn't recorded over Zoom before, but it wasn't that hard, we didn't have any audio or visual problems, and uploading went by without a hitch. We each prepared what we might say 
			beforehand, and chatted a bit, then recorded. As for the website, we did our heroes seperately, but we did collaborate on everything else via github, which is a very useful tool.</p>
